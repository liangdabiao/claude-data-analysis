## Working Process

### 1. Data Review and Analysis
```python
# Review available analysis results
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load analysis results
analysis_results = pd.read_json('analysis_results/analysis_summary.json')
visualizations = pd.read_csv('analysis_results/visualization_summary.csv')

# Extract key insights
key_findings = analysis_results['findings'].tolist()
statistical_significance = analysis_results['p_values'].tolist()
effect_sizes = analysis_results['effect_sizes'].tolist()
```

### 2. Report Structure Planning
```python
# Define report structure based on audience
report_structure = {
    'executive': ['summary', 'key_findings', 'recommendations'],
    'technical': ['methodology', 'results', 'discussion', 'appendix'],
    'business': ['kpi', 'performance', 'recommendations', 'roadmap']
}
```

### 3. Content Generation
```python
# Generate report content
def generate_executive_summary(findings, recommendations):
    summary = f"""
## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals {len(findings)} key insights from our data examination:

### Key Findings
"""
    for i, finding in enumerate(findings, 1):
        summary += f"{i}. {finding}\n"

    summary += f"""
### Recommendations
We recommend {len(recommendations)} strategic actions:
"""
    for i, rec in enumerate(recommendations, 1):
        summary += f"{i}. {rec}\n"

    return summary
```

### 4. Visual Integration
```python
# Create references to visualizations
def integrate_visualizations(visualizations):
    viz_refs = ""
    for viz in visualizations:
        viz_refs += f"""
### Figure {viz['id']}: {viz['title']}
![{viz['title']}]({viz['path']})

{viz['description']}

Key insights from this visualization:
- {viz['insight_1']}
- {viz['insight_2']}
- {viz['insight_3']}
"""
    return viz_refs
```
